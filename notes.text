To ensure that your website loads smoothly and provides a seamless user experience, it's a good practice to implement the loading screen, overlay, image resolution, and slide-in/slide-out transitions across all pages. You can achieve this by adding the necessary JavaScript code from `main.js` to each page where these functionalities are needed.

Here's the suggested approach:

1. `main.js`: Keep all the common functions and configurations in `main.js`, including the loading screen, overlay, image resolution, and slide-in/slide-out transitions.

2. `index.html` (Home Page):
   - Include a reference to `main.js` at the end of the `body` tag.
   - In the `script` section of `index.html`, call the `loadScreenFunc()` to show the loading screen and overlay.
   - Inside the `window.onload` function, call `removeOverlayWithTimer()` to remove the loading screen after the page has finished loading.

3. `products.html` (Product Catalog Page):
   - Include a reference to `main.js` at the end of the `body` tag.
   - In the `script` section of `products.html`, call the `loadScreenFunc()` to show the loading screen and overlay.
   - Inside the `window.onload` function, call `removeOverlayWithTimer()` to remove the loading screen after the page has finished loading.
   - Implement the image resolution conversion for images on this page using the `convertImagesToLowResolution()` function.

4. `product.html` (Product Detail Page):
   - Include a reference to `main.js` at the end of the `body` tag.
   - In the `script` section of `product.html`, call the `loadScreenFunc()` to show the loading screen and overlay.
   - Inside the `window.onload` function, call `removeOverlayWithTimer()` to remove the loading screen after the page has finished loading.
   - Implement the image resolution conversion for images on this page using the `convertImagesToLowResolution()` function.

5. `cart.html` (Cart Page):
   - Include a reference to `main.js` at the end of the `body` tag.
   - In the `script` section of `cart.html`, call the `loadScreenFunc()` to show the loading screen and overlay.
   - Inside the `window.onload` function, call `removeOverlayWithTimer()` to remove the loading screen after the page has finished loading.
   - Implement the image resolution conversion for images on this page using the `convertImagesToLowResolution()` function.

6. `checkout.html` (Checkout Page):
   - Include a reference to `main.js` at the end of the `body` tag.
   - In the `script` section of `checkout.html`, call the `loadScreenFunc()` to show the loading screen and overlay.
   - Inside the `window.onload` function, call `removeOverlayWithTimer()` to remove the loading screen after the page has finished loading.
   - Implement the image resolution conversion for images on this page using the `convertImagesToLowResolution()` function.

7. Other Pages (e.g., `gallery.html`, `contact.html`, `blog.html`, etc.):
   - Follow a similar pattern as the previous pages. Include a reference to `main.js`, call `loadScreenFunc()`, and use the necessary functions for image resolution and transitions.

By incorporating these functions and techniques on each page, you can ensure a consistent user experience throughout your website, with the loading screen, overlay, image resolution optimization, and slide-in/slide-out transitions applied wherever needed.
